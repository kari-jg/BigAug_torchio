# BigAug_torchio
This is my personal and unofficial implementation of the BigAug augmentation pipeline compatible with the torchio package. 

The BigAug augmentation pipeline originates from the paper *Generalizing Deep Learning for Medical Image Segmentation to Unseen Domains via Deep Stacked Transformation* by [Zhang et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8995481).

For example usage see: apply_BigAug.py

The transforms are implemented following the existing torchio transforms.
